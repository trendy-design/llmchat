        "You can convert an image to a Base64 string in JavaScript using the `FileReader` API. Here's a function that takes an image file as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the Base64 string of the image:\n\n```javascript\nfunction convertImageToBase64(file) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        const reader = new FileReader();\n\n        reader.onloadend = () => {\n            resolve(reader.result);\n        };\n\n        reader.onerror = () => {\n            reject(new Error('Error converting image to Base64'));\n        };\n\n        reader.readAsDataURL(file);\n    });\n}\n\n// Usage example\nconst inputElement = document.getElementById('imageInput');\n\ninputElement.addEventListener('change', (event) => {\n    const file = event.target.files[0];\n    if (file) {\n        convertImageToBase64(file)\n            .then(base64String => {\n                console.log('Base64 String:', base64String);\n            })\n            .catch(error => {\n                console.error(error);\n            });\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **FileReader**: This API allows web applications to asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer.\n  \n2. **readAsDataURL**: This method reads the contents of the specified `Blob` or `File` and returns a data URL representing the file's data as a Base64 encoded string.\n\n3. **Promise**: The function returns a Promise that resolves with the Base64 string once the reading is complete or rejects if an error occurs.\n\n### Usage:\n\n1. Create an `<input>` element in your HTML with `type=\"file\"` and an `id` of `imageInput`.\n2. When a file is selected, the `change` event is triggered, and the selected file is passed to the `convertImageToBase64` function.\n\nMake sure to handle the file input properly in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"file\" id=\"imageInput\" accept=\"image/*\" />\n```\n\nThis way, you can easily convert images to Base64 strings in your web applications!",

              "title: 24 Biggest Industries in the World in 2024 - InvestingChannel,markdown: In this article, we’ll take a look at the **24 Biggest Industries in the World in 2024.** The article also sheds light on what’s happening in the global economy and recent worldwide industrial developments. To skip the detailed analysis and have a quick overview of the top 10, read [**10**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-biggest-industries-in-the-world-in-2024-1241869/) **[Biggest Industries in the World in 2024](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-biggest-industries-in-the-world-in-2024-1241869/).** \n\n**Global Industrial Market Outlook for 2024**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOECD predicts the global economy to experience a significant slowdown in 2024, with growth rates dipping below historical averages. It projects the global economic growth rate at [2.7%](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/01/10/global-economic-prospects) in 2024, indicating a minor downturn from 2.9% in 2023. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also forecasts a deceleration in global growth, from 3.0% in 2023 to [2.9%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/10/10/world-economic-outlook-october-2023) in 2024, well below the historical average of 3.8%. \n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts a more optimistic outlook for the [global economy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-best-economy-world-192251451.html) in 2024 than many expect. The expectation is for continued income growth, cooling inflation, a robust job market, and a recovery in manufacturing. Central banks are predicted to have more leeway to reduce interest rates, providing a safeguard against recession. Global GDP is projected to grow by 2.6%, with strong performance expected across most of the world’s largest economies, including the United States. This positive outlook hinges on the anticipation that major economies will successfully navigate the transition from inflation control to minimizing recession risks​​.\n\nThis shows that the **global industrial market for 2024** is shaping up to be a year of both challenges and opportunities across various sectors.\n\nFor instance, the manufacturing industry is poised to capitalize on significant legislative developments in the United States. The US manufacturing industry is benefiting from significant legislative support, with investment in semiconductor and clean technology manufacturing nearly doubling from 2021 and about 20 times the amount allocated in 2019. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has led to the [formation](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html) of nearly 200 new clean technology manufacturing facilities, representing an investment of $88 billion and expected to create over 75,000 new jobs. As of July 2023, annual construction spending in manufacturing stood at $201 billion, a 70% year-over-year increase, indicating a positive trajectory for 2024​​.\n\nFrom a macroeconomic and geopolitical perspective, 2024 is anticipated to be a year marked by volatility and potential geopolitical risks, particularly in energy markets. This volatility arises from the geopolitical fracturing of the global system, influencing oil prices and introducing more variables and sources of risk premia. The US’s status as a net energy exporter and its relationship with Gulf states are also factors impacting global oil supply and prices. ​\n\nThe global trade markets show a resilient trend. Despite a projected [5%](https://unctad.org/news/global-trade-expected-shrink-nearly-5-2023-amid-geopolitical-strains-and-shifting-trade) contraction in global trade, a $500 billion increase in trade in services reflects the resilience and adaptability of global markets. Developing economies, especially Mexico and East Asian countries, are seizing the opportunity to integrate more deeply into global supply chains, largely influenced by geopolitical factors.\n\nAsia’s dominance in the global economy is increasingly evident, as it now accounts for over 50% of global trade value. With 18 of the 20 fastest-growing trade corridors, Asia’s economic significance is particularly notable in the trade growth observed along corridors between mainland China and regions like the UAE and Taiwan. The economic partnership between the UAE and China exemplifies this trend, with non-oil trade soaring to $72 billion in 2022, an 18% increase from the previous year, and overall bilateral trade reaching a record $99.3 billion. \n\n**Global Industrial Revolutions in 2023** \n------------------------------------------\n\n2023 was a landmark year for technological advancements, especially in the field of AI. Generative AI, in particular, has captured the world’s attention, finding applications in a variety of sectors from sales to software development. This innovative technology promises significant automation in tasks involving natural language, alongside substantial energy conservation, and it seems to remain the **biggest trend in 2024**. Google’s DeepMind AI in data centers, achieving up to a [40%](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-by-40/) reduction in energy consumption, is a testament to this progress. Furthermore, R&D on 6G networks promises a new era of connectivity, poised to transform industries and societies with unprecedented speed and flexibility.\n\nSustainable and green technologies are also making significant strides. For instance, Virgin Atlantic’s historic flight from London to New York in 2023 using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, made from plant and waste products, sets a new benchmark in reducing carbon emissions and addressing global warming.\n\n**Methodology** \n----------------\n\nFor our list of the largest industries in the world, We’ve ranked them in ascending order of their market caps. We have used data from the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=marketcap) screener for this purpose. \n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years ([see the details here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/all)).

            "title: 24 Biggest Industries in the World in 2024 - InvestingChannel,markdown: In this article, we’ll take a look at the **24 Biggest Industries in the World in 2024.** The article also sheds light on what’s happening in the global economy and recent worldwide industrial developments. To skip the detailed analysis and have a quick overview of the top 10, read [**10**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-biggest-industries-in-the-world-in-2024-1241869/) **[Biggest Industries in the World in 2024](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-biggest-industries-in-the-world-in-2024-1241869/).** \n\n**Global Industrial Market Outlook for 2024**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOECD predicts the global economy to experience a significant slowdown in 2024, with growth rates dipping below historical averages. It projects the global economic growth rate at [2.7%](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/01/10/global-economic-prospects) in 2024, indicating a minor downturn from 2.9% in 2023. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also forecasts a deceleration in global growth, from 3.0% in 2023 to [2.9%](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/10/10/world-economic-outlook-october-2023) in 2024, well below the historical average of 3.8%. \n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts a more optimistic outlook for the [global economy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-best-economy-world-192251451.html) in 2024 than many expect. The expectation is for continued income growth, cooling inflation, a robust job market, and a recovery in manufacturing. Central banks are predicted to have more leeway to reduce interest rates, providing a safeguard against recession. Global GDP is projected to grow by 2.6%, with strong performance expected across most of the world’s largest economies, including the United States. This positive outlook hinges on the anticipation that major economies will successfully navigate the transition from inflation control to minimizing recession risks​​.\n\nThis shows that the **global industrial market for 2024** is shaping up to be a year of both challenges and opportunities across various sectors.\n\nFor instance, the manufacturing industry is poised to capitalize on significant legislative developments in the United States. The US manufacturing industry is benefiting from significant legislative support, with investment in semiconductor and clean technology manufacturing nearly doubling from 2021 and about 20 times the amount allocated in 2019. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has led to the [formation](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html) of nearly 200 new clean technology manufacturing facilities, representing an investment of $88 billion and expected to create over 75,000 new jobs. As of July 2023, annual construction spending in manufacturing stood at $201 billion, a 70% year-over-year increase, indicating a positive trajectory for 2024​​.\n\nFrom a macroeconomic and geopolitical perspective, 2024 is anticipated to be a year marked by volatility and potential geopolitical risks, particularly in energy markets. This volatility arises from the geopolitical fracturing of the global system, influencing oil prices and introducing more variables and sources of risk premia. The US’s status as a net energy exporter and its relationship with Gulf states are also factors impacting global oil supply and prices. ​\n\nThe global trade markets show a resilient trend. Despite a projected [5%](https://unctad.org/news/global-trade-expected-shrink-nearly-5-2023-amid-geopolitical-strains-and-shifting-trade) contraction in global trade, a $500 billion increase in trade in services reflects the resilience and adaptability of global markets. Developing economies, especially Mexico and East Asian countries, are seizing the opportunity to integrate more deeply into global supply chains, largely influenced by geopolitical factors.\n\nAsia’s dominance in the global economy is increasingly evident, as it now accounts for over 50% of global trade value. With 18 of the 20 fastest-growing trade corridors, Asia’s economic significance is particularly notable in the trade growth observed along corridors between mainland China and regions like the UAE and Taiwan. The economic partnership between the UAE and China exemplifies this trend, with non-oil trade soaring to $72 billion in 2022, an 18% increase from the previous year, and overall bilateral trade reaching a record $99.3 billion. \n\n**Global Industrial Revolutions in 2023** \n------------------------------------------\n\n2023 was a landmark year for technological advancements, especially in the field of AI. Generative AI, in particular, has captured the world’s attention, finding applications in a variety of sectors from sales to software development. This innovative technology promises significant automation in tasks involving natural language, alongside substantial energy conservation, and it seems to remain the **biggest trend in 2024**. Google’s DeepMind AI in data centers, achieving up to a [40%](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-by-40/) reduction in energy consumption, is a testament to this progress. Furthermore, R&D on 6G networks promises a new era of connectivity, poised to transform industries and societies with unprecedented speed and flexibility.\n\nSustainable and green technologies are also making significant strides. For instance, Virgin Atlantic’s historic flight from London to New York in 2023 using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, made from plant and waste products, sets a new benchmark in reducing carbon emissions and addressing global warming.\n\n**Methodology** \n----------------\n\nFor our list of the largest industries in the world, We’ve ranked them in ascending order of their market caps. We have used data from the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=marketcap) screener for this purpose. \n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

              "title: The 100 Best Restaurants in New York City in 2024,markdown: ### Our critic, Pete Wells, drops his annual ranking. See what’s new, what moved and what left the list.\n\nI should have seen it coming last year when my editors put the following headline on my attempt to name the city’s greatest places to eat: “[The 100 Best Restaurants in New York City 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html).”\n\nThat “2023” implies doing it again in 2024. Still, when they told me that’s exactly what they wanted, my first reaction was surprise. This was followed by the realization that I had a lot of eating to do.\n\nTwenty-two places in this edition of “The 100 Best Restaurants in NYC” are new. I’ve eaten at all 100 in the past 12 months, except for La Piraña Lechonera and the Queens Night Market, both of which are currently closed for the season. (I don’t accept free meals from restaurants I write about.)\n\nNew York is a big city, and I tried to find 100 restaurants that represent its neighborhoods, its people and the rewards it has in store for hungry, curious eaters. The list is a tour. If you take it, you’ll see all five boroughs and a wide array of cooking and serving styles.\n\nThere are hushed counters where fewer than 10 people at a time enjoy the marvels a great sushi master can conjure, and open-air stalls where jerk chicken soaks up the smoke of hardwood charcoal. And quite a few restaurants in between.\n\nNot many people will eat at all of them. But if you read about them, I hope you will start to see New York the way I see it whenever I look at my options and ask myself where I am going to eat next.\n\n— _Pete Wells_\n\nShowing all 100 restaurants.\n\nGo ahead, ask Resy to ping you when a table at Tatiana becomes available. You might as well learn Icelandic while you’re at it, because you’re going to be waiting a while. Deep into its second year, after much of the hype about Mr. Onwuachi’s spirited rundown of Black cooking styles in New York (Southern, Caribbean, West African, bodega-esque) has blown over, Tatiana remains among the very few places in town where reservations are truly hard to come by. It’s quickly becoming an institution. Is it maturing, too? The truffled chopped cheese is now a satisfying and rather lush steak sandwich, a more fully realized recipe even though it may no longer quite qualify as a chopped cheese. Service can still register as under-rehearsed. Yet the people working at Tatiana, many of them newcomers in the restaurant trade, convey genuine warmth and enthusiasm, which I’ll gladly take over the chilly formalities that prevail in other restaurants that charge this much or more for dinner. Mr. Onwuachi clearly wants you to have fun at Tatiana, but I suspect he also wants you to ask why there aren’t more places like it.\n\nWhen the tasting counter in Roberta’s backyard finally reopened in January, it had something to show for its unusually long pandemic break: a new chef, Victoria Blamey. She works with Carlo Mirarchi, Blanca’s owner, within the nominally Italian outlines he established in its first decade: the esoteric raw seafood plates, the unexpected vegetable courses, the spare and thrilling bowls of pasta, the remarkable cuts of meat aged on site and painstakingly cooked over Japanese charcoal. But she builds on that structure, adding the intense flavors she loves (often from fermentation, as in the yuzu sauerkraut draped over raw surf clams) and some dishes drawn from the Chilean cuisine she grew up with (like tortilla de rescoldo, a flat and nearly black bread traditionally baked in ashes). Her far-reaching and forward-looking menu is served to a soundtrack provided by an open turntable and a stack of LPs. This has to be the only restaurant in the world where you can play side B of “Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves” while you wait for the pheasant course.\n\nYou can drop in for a fairly quick lunch, not the whole multi-installment chef’s tasting megillah, just a simple three courses for $127, in and out, no big deal, and still the cooking will make you feel as if tectonic plates were shifting under your feet. In January, what did it for me was the fluke. Boring old fluke, served all over town, where’s the thrill in that, Eric Ripert? And then one of the servers fills the white space around the fish with a sauce the color of saffron. It smells like fennel and lobster. The inspiration is bouillabaisse, right, but (tremor) why is it so briny and (rumble) rich and hey, um, is that (people run for cover …) sea urchin?\n\nAt this point Manhattan must have more Korean tasting counters than kosher delis. Atomix remains the one to beat, though, the leader in finding new ingredients (locally foraged pineapple weed and maple flower are on the spring menu), grounding its experiments in tradition and putting its meals into the larger context of Korean ceramics, fabrics and even chopstick design. The concrete dining room is more chilly than cuddly, but it has little of the pretension that afflicts some other tasting counters. Its earnestness is surprisingly appealing.\n\nMaybe you waited two hours for a table, maybe you lucked into a bar stool, maybe you took a reservation at one of those in-between times that are the only ones that ever seem to be offered. (At 4:15 p.m., are you having lunch or dinner?) In any case, as you hold up the broadsheet menu with its drawings of artichokes and figs, the old favorites compete for your attention: the crisp olives stuffed with pork, bruschetta under mounds of butter with a folded silvery anchovy on each mound, the slick tangle of tonnarelli studded with explosively fragrant peppercorns, the spreadably soft garlic cloves with golden sections of fried rabbit. There may not be another restaurant in town where so many dishes are indisputable classics, where, just when you think you’ve made up your mind, your eye falls on the meatballs sweetened with raisins and pine nuts …\n\nEach winter, the rickety, boarded-up trailer on East 152nd Street looks as if it won’t survive the next strong breeze. And each spring, Angel Jimenez unlocks the door, heats the deep fryer, powers up the salsa music, sharpens the machete and brings the city’s greatest expression of Puerto Rican eating back to life for another season. The frituras, little shrimp-filled pastelillos and shiny golden bacalaitos, are superb. So is the cold octopus salad, crunchy with diced peppers and olives. But the reason we wait all winter for La Piraña’s return is the roast pork. Rubbed with garlic and pepper, splashed with milky garlic sauce and, if you like, some vinegar-and-chile solution swirled in an empty rum bottle, it is the closest a New Yorker can get to a plate of slow-cooked lechon up in the mountains outside San Juan.\n\nThe city hasn’t quite caught up with Semma yet. To some extent we can blame the Unapologetic Foods group, which opens restaurants faster than Guided by Voices puts out albums. But the real issue is that we haven’t seen anything like Vijay Kumar’s interpretations of South Indian food before. Mr. Kumar doesn’t just toy with the distinction between refined and rustic; he obliterates it. The North Fork snails he sautées with tomatoes and tamarind would be cooked over a campfire in the rice paddies of Tamil Nadu, yet they get along with a glass of Pouilly-Fuissé from the Mâconnais as readily as any Burgundian escargot.\n\nDiner, vegetarian hangout, greenmarket evangelist, laboratory, improv collective, museum of East Village ephemera — ever since it moved to Avenue A last year, Superiority Burger has been trying out new personas, without discarding any of the old ones. The exceptional, airy focaccia that is the focus of a sizable cult is now sold by the slice, but only at the bar on Monday and Tuesday. Grab-and-go veggie burgers, “hippy poutine” and fried tofu sandwiches that turn every preconception about bean curd on its head are available on Thursday, Friday and Saturday after 11 p.m. (During this “Night Shift,” you can also eat a pie from the celebrated Chrissy’s Pizza pop-up, as long as you ordered ahead.) There is no time of day when you can’t get gelato and sorbet in freethinking flavors like saffron-labneh or tahini with fudge swirl. Waffles and other breakfast foods now materialize on weekends. Is this any way to run a hamburger stand? Yes, it is.\n\nAt his counter on the Bowery, Tadashi Yoshida can wow you into submission before he hands you the night’s first piece of sushi. Your omakase dinner might begin with a small cocktail of caviar and bigfin reef squid in sweet and tender strands. Mochi might follow, grilled over charcoal until crisp and chewy, then wrapped around sun-dried mullet roe, briny and intense. During certain weeks of the year there could be white sacs of cod milt. Or oysters and tilefish in a rich, breathtaking soup made from hairy crab. Mr. Yoshida’s appetizer repertoire seems to be endless. By the time he fills a brazier with live charcoal to sear the mackerel sushi that is his signature, showstopping dish, your surrender is complete.\n\nTorrisi is now turning out the most dazzling and accomplished cooking of all the Major Food Group restaurants. (The distinction used to belong to the Grill, which this year slides to No. 55 in my ranking.) Who knows what the future holds? But Rich Torrisi, standing in one corner of the open kitchen, conducting a crew that is equally adept with Vietnamese octopus as with tortellini folded as gracefully as a silk pocket square, certainly looks like a chef who has found his forever home.\n\nThe food seems slightly more familiar than it did when Ignacio Mattos brought Estela to Houston Street in 2013. One reason for this is that small-plates restaurants across the country have helped themselves to its unexpected flavor harmonies and unforced visual aesthetic. Some even lifted entire recipes. Never mind the imitators, though. An Estela dish can still knock you over with originality. Where else can you get orange segments under a floss of dried shrimp and Thai chile threads? Nowhere, yet.\n\nA couple of years ago, Una Pizza was half-empty so often that its owner, Anthony Mangieri, was thinking of pulling up stakes. Then he did an about-face — or maybe we did. Now, he and his pizza are acknowledged downtown institutions. Fans buy Una Pizza-branded apparel, extra-virgin olive oil and panettone; they begin lining up half an hour before the doors open; and they’ve made reservations among the city’s most scalpable. The source of this fevered loyalty is the five standard pies and a weekly special, all of them with a fat, tender, char-speckled Hula-Hoop of dough surrounding a low valley of tomatoes or cheese or both. There’s not much else on the menu, but the fire-roasted peppers are worthwhile and the sorbetto can be stunning.\n\nI know people who refused to try Ci Siamo for a while because it’s located in Nowheresville — the concrete future-scape known as Manhattan West. Then they went, and they got lost. They complained about the schlep before, during and after the next visit. But when they found themselves planning a third meal, they were forced to admit that Hillary Sterling has put Nowheresville on the map. There are other chefs in town with a wood-burning hearth and a love of rustic Italian flavors, but Ms. Sterling’s menu may have the highest percentage of dishes that are flat-out fantastic.\n\nIt can be depressing when restaurants are cloned, but for Jean-Georges Vongerichten there were undeniable advantages to making a branch of ABCV out of his vegetarian hide-out, Seeds & Weeds, in the Tin Building. For one, an outright copy can be better than a halfhearted imitation. ABCV’s executive chef, Neal Harden, has spent years studying interesting ways to eat grains, roots, fungi and so on. His food is so much more advanced than it is at other, similar places that eating there can be like time-traveling and discovering that the post-livestock future turned out extremely well. If ABCV can be cloned successfully, we may not need to clone meat.\n\nThe cooking of Jiangnan, including Shanghai and the cities of the southern Yangtze Delta, gets the nuanced treatment it deserves at CheLi. Instead of, say, scorching chiles or other powerful seasonings, Jiangnan uses Shaoxing wine to provide subtle, invisible emphasis in many dishes, like chilled wine-soaked crab and stir-fried loofah. Dragonwell tea scents the soft curls of sweet Longjing shrimp, which come to the table enveloped in dry-ice fog. Delicate is probably not the best word for CheLi’s mao xue wang, a majestic stew of ham, beef, shrimp, intestines and congealed duck’s blood, all bobbing under a quarter-inch or so of chile oil. But it’s not wrong, either.\n\nGetting a table is no easy feat, but apart from that, Jeju is one of the city’s most accessible modern Korean restaurants — a crowded category that has more than its share of tasting menus with triple-digit prices. The quietly marvelous mushroom ramen, with Parmesan foam and a squeeze of lime, is a meal in itself, and costs $27. For about the same price there are seafood appetizers, such as rosy cubes of raw kinmedai and clams in a dill- and chive-scented broth, so carefully considered they could be airlifted right into a 12-course degustation, although they’d probably have to be a tenth the size.\n\nWhatever picture floats through your mind when you think of a rock star’s restaurant, it probably doesn’t resemble the Four Horsemen, owned in part by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. There is no grandstanding, no concert memorabilia and very little debauchery unless you count the four-top of wine-business insiders in the back drinking magnums of organic, wild-fermented Champagne from Georges Laval. What the restaurant does have is a low-key obsession with excellence. You see it in the attention to brewing tea and coffee, in the basket-drained ricotta made daily in kitchen, in the unfussy seasonality of Nick Curtola’s menus, and in the way the servers seem to know all about the wines but aren’t in a rush to prove it. Like everything else at this serious little restaurant, it just seems to happen naturally.\n\nSometimes when I land at JFK, I am tempted to make the 10-minute drive to Trinciti so I can refresh myself with two or three Trini chicken curry doubles and a couple of aloo pies, slit open and filled with shrimp and tamarind chutney. But the sad truth is that I’m always too tired from traveling, and there’s no place to sit at Trinciti. Plus, you need your wits about you simply to order, particularly on the weekend, when there is one line for bake and shark, another for all the other food, and a third to pay. Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the only days you can get bake and shark — spicy, sweet, tangy and crunchy in about five different ways, it is the greatest fish sandwich in the five boroughs. So I treat Trinciti as a destination of its own, worth a separate trip.\n\nBy this point, Jean-Georges Vongerichten shouldn’t have any tricks left up his sleeve. But a six- or 10-course dinner at his urbane, understated restaurant on Columbus Circle is almost sure to deliver something you didn’t quite see coming. Wagyu tenderloin with braised endive might look like a simple steakhouse riff, but how can that sticky and intensely fruity hoisin sauce get along so well with a jus that carries the fragile perfume of bergamot? How can citrus segments, spicy Fresno chiles and shiso oil be piled on top of raw scallops without crushing their sweetness? Sean Considine, the pastry chef, makes sure the surprises start up again with dessert and continue through the final barrage of marshmallows, pâtes de fruits and chocolates.\n\nMam is still something of a rough draft, but it is looking more and more like a serious restaurant. True, the miniature kitchen, miniature dining room and miniature plastic furniture were part of what made Mam so charming in its early days on Forsyth Street, when Jerald and Nhung Dao Head were dishing out Hanoi-style bun dau mam tom to a small audience at what seemed to be a pop-up. The crowds grew as word got out about the housemade fried tofu, the blood sausage, the fish mint and other Vietnamese herbs, and the fermented shrimp sauce that made everything taste better. But crowds and small quarters are not made for each other. Last year, the Heads signed a lease on a space next door. Meanwhile, Mr. Head has been adding to his repertory, applying his obsessive, detail-oriented attention to, among other things, a pho bo that rivals his bun dau mam tom.\n\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, exciting young restaurants are doomed to become less exciting with age. At 20 years old, Casa Mono and its wine-bar annex next door, Bar Jamón, gracefully defy that law every day. Andy Nusser hasn’t lost his appreciation for the strong, elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine: smoky eggplant purée beneath fried baby squid; the paprika blast of the raw, spreadable pork sausage sobrasada, to be smeared on golden toast with waxy chunks of honeycomb. The nose-to-tail fad has come and gone, and Casa Mono sails on placidly, flying the flag of lambs’ tongues and pigs’ ears.

            "title: The 100 Best Restaurants in New York City in 2024,markdown: ### Our critic, Pete Wells, drops his annual ranking. See what’s new, what moved and what left the list.\n\nI should have seen it coming last year when my editors put the following headline on my attempt to name the city’s greatest places to eat: “[The 100 Best Restaurants in New York City 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html).”\n\nThat “2023” implies doing it again in 2024. Still, when they told me that’s exactly what they wanted, my first reaction was surprise. This was followed by the realization that I had a lot of eating to do.\n\nTwenty-two places in this edition of “The 100 Best Restaurants in NYC” are new. I’ve eaten at all 100 in the past 12 months, except for La Piraña Lechonera and the Queens Night Market, both of which are currently closed for the season. (I don’t accept free meals from restaurants I write about.)\n\nNew York is a big city, and I tried to find 100 restaurants that represent its neighborhoods, its people and the rewards it has in store for hungry, curious eaters. The list is a tour. If you take it, you’ll see all five boroughs and a wide array of cooking and serving styles.\n\nThere are hushed counters where fewer than 10 people at a time enjoy the marvels a great sushi master can conjure, and open-air stalls where jerk chicken soaks up the smoke of hardwood charcoal. And quite a few restaurants in between.\n\nNot many people will eat at all of them. But if you read about them, I hope you will start to see New York the way I see it whenever I look at my options and ask myself where I am going to eat next.\n\n— _Pete Wells_\n\nShowing all 100 restaurants.\n\nGo ahead, ask Resy to ping you when a table at Tatiana becomes available. You might as well learn Icelandic while you’re at it, because you’re going to be waiting a while. Deep into its second year, after much of the hype about Mr. Onwuachi’s spirited rundown of Black cooking styles in New York (Southern, Caribbean, West African, bodega-esque) has blown over, Tatiana remains among the very few places in town where reservations are truly hard to come by. It’s quickly becoming an institution. Is it maturing, too? The truffled chopped cheese is now a satisfying and rather lush steak sandwich, a more fully realized recipe even though it may no longer quite qualify as a chopped cheese. Service can still register as under-rehearsed. Yet the people working at Tatiana, many of them newcomers in the restaurant trade, convey genuine warmth and enthusiasm, which I’ll gladly take over the chilly formalities that prevail in other restaurants that charge this much or more for dinner. Mr. Onwuachi clearly wants you to have fun at Tatiana, but I suspect he also wants you to ask why there aren’t more places like it.\n\nWhen the tasting counter in Roberta’s backyard finally reopened in January, it had something to show for its unusually long pandemic break: a new chef, Victoria Blamey. She works with Carlo Mirarchi, Blanca’s owner, within the nominally Italian outlines he established in its first decade: the esoteric raw seafood plates, the unexpected vegetable courses, the spare and thrilling bowls of pasta, the remarkable cuts of meat aged on site and painstakingly cooked over Japanese charcoal. But she builds on that structure, adding the intense flavors she loves (often from fermentation, as in the yuzu sauerkraut draped over raw surf clams) and some dishes drawn from the Chilean cuisine she grew up with (like tortilla de rescoldo, a flat and nearly black bread traditionally baked in ashes). Her far-reaching and forward-looking menu is served to a soundtrack provided by an open turntable and a stack of LPs. This has to be the only restaurant in the world where you can play side B of “Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves” while you wait for the pheasant course.\n\nYou can drop in for a fairly quick lunch, not the whole multi-installment chef’s tasting megillah, just a simple three courses for $127, in and out, no big deal, and still the cooking will make you feel as if tectonic plates were shifting under your feet. In January, what did it for me was the fluke. Boring old fluke, served all over town, where’s the thrill in that, Eric Ripert? And then one of the servers fills the white space around the fish with a sauce the color of saffron. It smells like fennel and lobster. The inspiration is bouillabaisse, right, but (tremor) why is it so briny and (rumble) rich and hey, um, is that (people run for cover …) sea urchin?\n\nAt this point Manhattan must have more Korean tasting counters than kosher delis. Atomix remains the one to beat, though, the leader in finding new ingredients (locally foraged pineapple weed and maple flower are on the spring menu), grounding its experiments in tradition and putting its meals into the larger context of Korean ceramics, fabrics and even chopstick design. The concrete dining room is more chilly than cuddly, but it has little of the pretension that afflicts some other tasting counters. Its earnestness is surprisingly appealing.\n\nMaybe you waited two hours for a table, maybe you lucked into a bar stool, maybe you took a reservation at one of those in-between times that are the only ones that ever seem to be offered. (At 4:15 p.m., are you having lunch or dinner?) In any case, as you hold up the broadsheet menu with its drawings of artichokes and figs, the old favorites compete for your attention: the crisp olives stuffed with pork, bruschetta under mounds of butter with a folded silvery anchovy on each mound, the slick tangle of tonnarelli studded with explosively fragrant peppercorns, the spreadably soft garlic cloves with golden sections of fried rabbit. There may not be another restaurant in town where so many dishes are indisputable classics, where, just when you think you’ve made up your mind, your eye falls on the meatballs sweetened with raisins and pine nuts …\n\nEach winter, the rickety, boarded-up trailer on East 152nd Street looks as if it won’t survive the next strong breeze. And each spring, Angel Jimenez unlocks the door, heats the deep fryer, powers up the salsa music, sharpens the machete and brings the city’s greatest expression of Puerto Rican eating back to life for another season. The frituras, little shrimp-filled pastelillos and shiny golden bacalaitos, are superb. So is the cold octopus salad, crunchy with diced peppers and olives. But the reason we wait all winter for La Piraña’s return is the roast pork. Rubbed with garlic and pepper, splashed with milky garlic sauce and, if you like, some vinegar-and-chile solution swirled in an empty rum bottle, it is the closest a New Yorker can get to a plate of slow-cooked lechon up in the mountains outside San Juan.\n\nThe city hasn’t quite caught up with Semma yet. To some extent we can blame the Unapologetic Foods group, which opens restaurants faster than Guided by Voices puts out albums. But the real issue is that we haven’t seen anything like Vijay Kumar’s interpretations of South Indian food before. Mr. Kumar doesn’t just toy with the distinction between refined and rustic; he obliterates it. The North Fork snails he sautées with tomatoes and tamarind would be cooked over a campfire in the rice paddies of Tamil Nadu, yet they get along with a glass of Pouilly-Fuissé from the Mâconnais as readily as any Burgundian escargot.\n\nDiner, vegetarian hangout, greenmarket evangelist, laboratory, improv collective, museum of East Village ephemera — ever since it moved to Avenue A last year, Superiority Burger has been trying out new personas, without discarding any of the old ones. The exceptional, airy focaccia that is the focus of a sizable cult is now sold by the slice, but only at the bar on Monday and Tuesday. Grab-and-go veggie burgers, “hippy poutine” and fried tofu sandwiches that turn every preconception about bean curd on its head are available on Thursday, Friday and Saturday after 11 p.m. (During this “Night Shift,” you can also eat a pie from the celebrated Chrissy’s Pizza pop-up, as long as you ordered ahead.) There is no time of day when you can’t get gelato and sorbet in freethinking flavors like saffron-labneh or tahini with fudge swirl. Waffles and other breakfast foods now materialize on weekends. Is this any way to run a hamburger stand? Yes, it is.\n\nAt his counter on the Bowery, Tadashi Yoshida can wow you into submission before he hands you the night’s first piece of sushi. Your omakase dinner might begin with a small cocktail of caviar and bigfin reef squid in sweet and tender strands. Mochi might follow, grilled over charcoal until crisp and chewy, then wrapped around sun-dried mullet roe, briny and intense. During certain weeks of the year there could be white sacs of cod milt. Or oysters and tilefish in a rich, breathtaking soup made from hairy crab. Mr. Yoshida’s appetizer repertoire seems to be endless. By the time he fills a brazier with live charcoal to sear the mackerel sushi that is his signature, showstopping dish, your surrender is complete.\n\nTorrisi is now turning out the most dazzling and accomplished cooking of all the Major Food Group restaurants. (The distinction used to belong to the Grill, which this year slides to No. 55 in my ranking.) Who knows what the future holds? But Rich Torrisi, standing in one corner of the open kitchen, conducting a crew that is equally adept with Vietnamese octopus as with tortellini folded as gracefully as a silk pocket square, certainly looks like a chef who has found his forever home.\n\nThe food seems slightly more familiar than it did when Ignacio Mattos brought Estela to Houston Street in 2013. One reason for this is that small-plates restaurants across the country have helped themselves to its unexpected flavor harmonies and unforced visual aesthetic. Some even lifted entire recipes. Never mind the imitators, though. An Estela dish can still knock you over with originality. Where else can you get orange segments under a floss of dried shrimp and Thai chile threads? Nowhere, yet.\n\nA couple of years ago, Una Pizza was half-empty so often that its owner, Anthony Mangieri, was thinking of pulling up stakes. Then he did an about-face — or maybe we did. Now, he and his pizza are acknowledged downtown institutions. Fans buy Una Pizza-branded apparel, extra-virgin olive oil and panettone; they begin lining up half an hour before the doors open; and they’ve made reservations among the city’s most scalpable. The source of this fevered loyalty is the five standard pies and a weekly special, all of them with a fat, tender, char-speckled Hula-Hoop of dough surrounding a low valley of tomatoes or cheese or both. There’s not much else on the menu, but the fire-roasted peppers are worthwhile and the sorbetto can be stunning.\n\nI know people who refused to try Ci Siamo for a while because it’s located in Nowheresville — the concrete future-scape known as Manhattan West. Then they went, and they got lost. They complained about the schlep before, during and after the next visit. But when they found themselves planning a third meal, they were forced to admit that Hillary Sterling has put Nowheresville on the map. There are other chefs in town with a wood-burning hearth and a love of rustic Italian flavors, but Ms. Sterling’s menu may have the highest percentage of dishes that are flat-out fantastic.\n\nIt can be depressing when restaurants are cloned, but for Jean-Georges Vongerichten there were undeniable advantages to making a branch of ABCV out of his vegetarian hide-out, Seeds & Weeds, in the Tin Building. For one, an outright copy can be better than a halfhearted imitation. ABCV’s executive chef, Neal Harden, has spent years studying interesting ways to eat grains, roots, fungi and so on. His food is so much more advanced than it is at other, similar places that eating there can be like time-traveling and discovering that the post-livestock future turned out extremely well. If ABCV can be cloned successfully, we may not need to clone meat.\n\nThe cooking of Jiangnan, including Shanghai and the cities of the southern Yangtze Delta, gets the nuanced treatment it deserves at CheLi. Instead of, say, scorching chiles or other powerful seasonings, Jiangnan uses Shaoxing wine to provide subtle, invisible emphasis in many dishes, like chilled wine-soaked crab and stir-fried loofah. Dragonwell tea scents the soft curls of sweet Longjing shrimp, which come to the table enveloped in dry-ice fog. Delicate is probably not the best word for CheLi’s mao xue wang, a majestic stew of ham, beef, shrimp, intestines and congealed duck’s blood, all bobbing under a quarter-inch or so of chile oil. But it’s not wrong, either.\n\nGetting a table is no easy feat, but apart from that, Jeju is one of the city’s most accessible modern Korean restaurants — a crowded category that has more than its share of tasting menus with triple-digit prices. The quietly marvelous mushroom ramen, with Parmesan foam and a squeeze of lime, is a meal in itself, and costs $27. For about the same price there are seafood appetizers, such as rosy cubes of raw kinmedai and clams in a dill- and chive-scented broth, so carefully considered they could be airlifted right into a 12-course degustation, although they’d probably have to be a tenth the size.\n\nWhatever picture floats through your mind when you think of a rock star’s restaurant, it probably doesn’t resemble the Four Horsemen, owned in part by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. There is no grandstanding, no concert memorabilia and very little debauchery unless you count the four-top of wine-business insiders in the back drinking magnums of organic, wild-fermented Champagne from Georges Laval. What the restaurant does have is a low-key obsession with excellence. You see it in the attention to brewing tea and coffee, in the basket-drained ricotta made daily in kitchen, in the unfussy seasonality of Nick Curtola’s menus, and in the way the servers seem to know all about the wines but aren’t in a rush to prove it. Like everything else at this serious little restaurant, it just seems to happen naturally.\n\nSometimes when I land at JFK, I am tempted to make the 10-minute drive to Trinciti so I can refresh myself with two or three Trini chicken curry doubles and a couple of aloo pies, slit open and filled with shrimp and tamarind chutney. But the sad truth is that I’m always too tired from traveling, and there’s no place to sit at Trinciti. Plus, you need your wits about you simply to order, particularly on the weekend, when there is one line for bake and shark, another for all the other food, and a third to pay. Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the only days you can get bake and shark — spicy, sweet, tangy and crunchy in about five different ways, it is the greatest fish sandwich in the five boroughs. So I treat Trinciti as a destination of its own, worth a separate trip.\n\nBy this point, Jean-Georges Vongerichten shouldn’t have any tricks left up his sleeve. But a six- or 10-course dinner at his urbane, understated restaurant on Columbus Circle is almost sure to deliver something you didn’t quite see coming. Wagyu tenderloin with braised endive might look like a simple steakhouse riff, but how can that sticky and intensely fruity hoisin sauce get along so well with a jus that carries the fragile perfume of bergamot? How can citrus segments, spicy Fresno chiles and shiso oil be piled on top of raw scallops without crushing their sweetness? Sean Considine, the pastry chef, makes sure the surprises start up again with dessert and continue through the final barrage of marshmallows, pâtes de fruits and chocolates.\n\nMam is still something of a rough draft, but it is looking more and more like a serious restaurant. True, the miniature kitchen, miniature dining room and miniature plastic furniture were part of what made Mam so charming in its early days on Forsyth Street, when Jerald and Nhung Dao Head were dishing out Hanoi-style bun dau mam tom to a small audience at what seemed to be a pop-up. The crowds grew as word got out about the housemade fried tofu, the blood sausage, the fish mint and other Vietnamese herbs, and the fermented shrimp sauce that made everything taste better. But crowds and small quarters are not made for each other. Last year, the Heads signed a lease on a space next door. Meanwhile, Mr. Head has been adding to his repertory, applying his obsessive, detail-oriented attention to, among other things, a pho bo that rivals his bun dau mam tom.\n\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, exciting young restaurants are doomed to become less exciting with age. At 20 years old, Casa Mono and its wine-bar annex next door, Bar Jamón, gracefully defy that law every day. Andy Nusser hasn’t lost his appreciation for the strong, elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine: smoky eggplant purée beneath fried baby squid; the paprika blast of the raw, spreadable pork sausage sobrasada, to be smeared on golden toast with waxy chunks of honeycomb. The nose-to-tail fad has come and gone, and Casa Mono sails on placidly, flying the flag of lambs’ tongues and pigs’ ears. The wine list has grown to about 600 Spanish bottles: serious Cava, aged Rioja and avant-gardists from all over.\n\nThere are no bad seats at Kono, a dramatic, black-walled yakitori on an alley in Chinatown. The stools on either side of the grill, though, have the best view of the chef, Atsushi Kono. He never stops moving. All night he’s turning, poking, relocating and examining chicken skewers, placing one over searing heat, letting another rest above a cooler patch of charcoal. His hypervigilance produces degrees of tenderness and juiciness and crunchiness that can make you feel as if you’re eating chicken for the first time.\n\nYou sometimes hear that you can find every cuisine on earth somewhere in Queens.
